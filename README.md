## How to compile and run our program.
***Before we begin, please know that our program was made using IntelliJ, and the instructions below should also be done in IntelliJ.

First, create a project on IntelliJ, and in the src folder, put all the classes inside it. Meanwhile, place all the text files outside of the src folder, but inside the project folder.

The classes that are NOT testing classes are Course, LmsMain, People, Question, Quiz, Student, Submission, and Teacher; all other classes are testing classes.

***IMPORTANT: Make sure that if you want to run the program as if it is being run for the first time, make sure that the People.txt file is empty, and that only the text files that are submitted on the Vocareum workspace exist. If you don't do this, testing and non testing classes will not function properly.
